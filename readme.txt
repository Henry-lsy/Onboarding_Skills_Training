Hi there, nice to meet you. I am your personal tour guide.

-------------------------------------------------------

First of all, please introduce yourself.
(If you want to change something on the master branch, a good habit is to create a new branch and make your changes there.)
(Create a new branch named "my_profile", and then fill in the following space)

you:
My name is _________, it is glad to see you.

(Please commit your modification and name it "add my name".)
(Please merge your branch "my_profile" to the master branch.)

--------------------------------------------------------

(You should return to the master branch here!!!!!)

Let us begin our journey. Now you need to answer a ROS test, and add the content of the "ros_question" branch below.
(Please switch to the branch "ros_question")

(merge all the content of ros_question here...)

--------------------------------------------------------

The next project is learning your basic knowledge of ROS programming. (Optional)

(Please switch to the branch "ros_programming_exercise")
(After finishing this project, merge this project to the master branch!!)

--------------------------------------------------------
(You should return to the master branch here!!!!!)

Congratulations! We are nearing the end of our journey. It would be great if you share your experience with others.
You need to create a remote git repo and push your local git repo to it.

(Create a new repo on GitHub, and push your current repo to it.)
